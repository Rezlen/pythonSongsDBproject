# Challenge; two separate servers
it is a challenge for every developer to connect a remote MySql database to a remote web server. I just managed to do so by having & customizing PlanetScale https://planetscale.com/ MySql database Connect it to server https://app.netlify.com/

# Integration into my VScode
Interestingly I have setup a live PlanetScale Database terminal called: PSCALE right in my VSCode so I can modify everything live from my VScode while committing/sending everything to GitHub (https://github.com/Rezlen/pythonSongsDBproject) immediately with a press of button.

# Cost
The very interesting point is that both PlanetScale & Netlify are free! 

# PYscript for front end website
Here I have used the one year old PYscript for marrying the Python code to HTML CSS so the code is usable live & for members of public: https://python-songs-db.netlify.app PyScript is frontend language replacing & simplifying Python's Flask for front end
